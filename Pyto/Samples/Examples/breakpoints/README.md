# Breakpoints

Breakpoints are a feature of pdb (python debugger) that can stop a program at a certain line and examine the environment.

To add a breakpoint, press the ant icon on the editor (Debugger) and select a line on a script. For the breakpoints to take effect, you need to run a script on debug mode, from the same Debugger menu.

To exit the debugger, type 'exit' on the (Pdb) console.
